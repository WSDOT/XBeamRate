 Permanent Loads<!--kadov_tag{{</variable>}}--></h1>

<p>Because our pier is defined independently from the bridge, we have to 
 supply the permanent load reactions from the superstructure. Permanent 
 load reactions and permanent load factors are defined on the Permanent 
 Loads page.</p>

<h6>Load Factors</h6>

<p>The permanent load factors for the applicable LRFD limit states are 
 entered in the Load Factors group. Enter load factors for the DC, DW, 
 CR, SH, and PS load cases as applicable.</p>

<h6>Bearings and Reactions</h6>

<p>The superstructure reactions are applied to the pier model through the 
 bearing locations. There can be one or two bearing lines at a pier. One 
 bearing line is typically used for Continuous and Integral piers while 
 two bearing lines are typically used for Expansion piers. </p>

<p>The superstructure reaction can be applied as a concentrated load at 
 the bearing locations or as a uniform load, spread over a specified width, 
 centered on each bearing location.</p>

<p>Use the + and - buttons to add and remove bearing locations from the 
 grid.</p>

<p>For each bearing entry in the grid enter the DC, DW, CR, SH, RE, and 
 PS reactions. Also enter the spacing (S) between each bearing location. 
 For some girder types, such as precast slabs, the reactions are spread 
 over a width, W.</p>

<p>The location of the bearings with respect to the overall pier geometry 
 is defined by entering the Centerline (CL) Bearing of a specific bearing 
 as an offset from either the Alignment or Bridge Line.</p>

<p>The permanent load consist of all the loads in the DC and DW load cases 
 as well as any secondary effects from the CR, SH, RE, and PS load cases. 
 The self weight of the cross beam and the upper diaphragm are automatically 
 computed by XBRate and should not be included in the DC load.</p>
