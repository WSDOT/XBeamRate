<p>The load rating report contains the results of the load rating analysis 
 as well as all the supporting information including the detailed computation 
 of rating factors and cross beam shear and moment capacity.</p>

<h6>Load Rating Chapter</h6>

<p>The Load Rating Chapter lists the load ratings for the Design, Legal 
 and Permit cases. For the design rating the rating factor for positive 
 moment, negative moment, and shear, along with the live load factor and 
 controlling point are reported for the Inventory and Operating cases.</p>

<p>The rating factor for each vehicle analyzed as well as the live load 
 factor, controlling point, and cause of the minimum rating factor are 
 reported for the legal and permit cases. If the rating factor for the 
 legal case is less than one, a load posting analysis is automatically 
 performed and the results list here.</p>

<h6>Load Rating Details Chapter</h6>

<p>This chapter lists the details of the load rating analysis. The details 
 include the rating factor equation and all the parameters used to compute 
 the rating factor.</p>

<p>The live load case column lists the Live Load Configuration and the 
 vehicle type that produce the controlling rating factor. The number following 
 LC corresponds to the Live Load Configuration listed in the <a HREF="Live_Load_Results_Graph.htm">Live 
 Load Results Graph</a> discussed later in this chapter. For the design 
 rating cases, the design live load governing, indicated by D and a number, 
 are listed at the bottom of the table. The Live Load Case for permit load 
 ratings, using the WSDOT BDM method, consist of a Live Load Configuration 
 number and the lane where the permit vehicle is placed to cause the minimum 
 rating factor. A Live Load Case of LC16543,P2 means the minimum rating 
 factor occurred for live load configuration 16543 with the permit vehicle 
 in lane 2.</p>

<p>Rating factors that are greater than 10 are listed as 10+.</p>

<p>The rows in the load rating details table consist of the rating factors 
 evaluated at 1'-0&quot; increments, the controlling location, and any 
 location evaluated where the rating factor is less than 1.0.</p>

<h6>Pier Description Details Chapter</h6>

<p>This chapter provides a complete listing of the pier description input.</p>

<h6>Loading Details Chapter</h6>

<p>This chapter provides the load factors and the details of all input 
 and generated loadings.</p>

<h6>Moment Capacity Details</h6>

<p>This chapter provides the details that show how the moment capacity 
 is computed.</p>

<h6>Shear Capacity Details</h6>

<p>This chapter provides the details that show how the shear capacity is 
 computed.</p>
