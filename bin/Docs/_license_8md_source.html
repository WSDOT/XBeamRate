By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation&#39;s software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.)

Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.</div><div class="line"><a name="l00015"></a><span class="lineno">   15</span>&#160;</div><div class="line"><a name="l00016"></a><span class="lineno">   16</span>&#160;To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.

All terms and conditions of this License apply to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of the Alternate Route Open Source License. The &quot;Program&quot;, below, refers to any such program or work. A &quot;work based on the Program&quot; means a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications to either its code, or to its non-code elements (such as specifications or formulas), and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.) A &quot;work based on the Program&quot; may be the Program, Program output (independent of having been made by running the Program), or any derivative work under copyright law.  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.</div><div class="line"><a name="l00035"></a><span class="lineno">   35</span>&#160;</div><div class="line"><a name="l00036"></a><span class="lineno">   36</span>&#160;2. Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not restricted by this License. The act of running the Program is not restricted, unless the output from the Program includes work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does. The output made by running the program (i.e., bridge design or specifications) is also subject to WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER, ASSUMPTION OF RISK, AND INDEMNIFICATION CLAUSES, as specified below.</div><div class="line"><a name="l00037"></a><span class="lineno">   37</span>&#160;</div><div class="line"><a name="l00038"></a><span class="lineno">   38</span>&#160;3. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice, and the warranty, disclaimer, assumption of risk and indemnification clauses from this License; keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and provide any other recipients of the Program with a copy of this License so that they may decide whether to use the Program according to the License terms. You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.</div><div class="line"><a name="l00039"></a><span class="lineno">   39</span>&#160;</div><div class="line"><a name="l00040"></a><span class="lineno">   40</span>&#160;4. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 3 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</div><div class="line"><a name="l00041"></a><span class="lineno">   41</span>&#160;* a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</div><div class="line"><a name="l00042"></a><span class="lineno">   42</span>&#160;* b) You may not use the name of the Program to refer to or identify the modified Program or work based on the Program. Instead, you must appropriately identify a new name that allows others to easily distinguish any modified version from the original version.</div><div class="line"><a name="l00043"></a><span class="lineno">   43</span>&#160;* c) Any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, must be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License. The manner of distribution must designed to provide the potential user with a reasonable opportunity to review the terms of this License prior to use or modification of the Library in accordance with the License terms.</div><div class="line"><a name="l00044"></a><span class="lineno">   44</span>&#160;* d) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to display an announcement including the copyright notice and notice of warranty, disclaimer, assumption of risk and indemnification from this License, that users may use and redistribute the program under the License conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. The display should include a feature that requires the potential user to acknowledge the contents of the display through a mouse-click (or other key stroke) before continuing through the interactive program. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may choose to provide your own warranty.</div><div class="line"><a name="l00045"></a><span class="lineno">   45</span>&#160;</div><div class="line"><a name="l00046"></a><span class="lineno">   46</span>&#160;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.</div><div class="line"><a name="l00047"></a><span class="lineno">   47</span>&#160;</div><div class="line"><a name="l00048"></a><span class="lineno">   48</span>&#160;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.</div><div class="line"><a name="l00049"></a><span class="lineno">   49</span>&#160;</div><div class="line"><a name="l00050"></a><span class="lineno">   50</span>&#160;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.</div><div class="line"><a name="l00051"></a><span class="lineno">   51</span>&#160;</div><div class="line"><a name="l00052"></a><span class="lineno">   52</span>&#160;5.

For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable. </div><div class="line"><a name="l00058"></a><span class="lineno">   58</span>&#160;</div><div class="line"><a name="l00059"></a><span class="lineno">   59</span>&#160;If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</div><div class="line"><a name="l00060"></a><span class="lineno">   60</span>&#160;</div><div class="line"><a name="l00061"></a><span class="lineno">   61</span>&#160;6. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License, while leaving the rights of the Licensor and all other Licensees intact. However, parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.</div><div class="line"><a name="l00062"></a><span class="lineno">   62</span>&#160;</div><div class="line"><a name="l00063"></a><span class="lineno">   63</span>&#160;7.

You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.</div><div class="line"><a name="l00068"></a><span class="lineno">   68</span>&#160;</div><div class="line"><a name="l00069"></a><span class="lineno">   69</span>&#160;10. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.</div><div class="line"><a name="l00070"></a><span class="lineno">   70</span>&#160;</div><div class="line"><a name="l00071"></a><span class="lineno">   71</span>&#160;11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.</div><div class="line"><a name="l00072"></a><span class="lineno">   72</span>&#160;</div><div class="line"><a name="l00073"></a><span class="lineno">   73</span>&#160;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.</div><div class="line"><a name="l00074"></a><span class="lineno">   74</span>&#160;</div><div class="line"><a name="l00075"></a><span class="lineno">   75</span>&#160;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.</div><div class="line"><a name="l00076"></a><span class="lineno">   76</span>&#160;</div><div class="line"><a name="l00077"></a><span class="lineno">   77</span>&#160;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.</div><div class="line"><a name="l00078"></a><span class="lineno">   78</span>&#160;</div><div class="line"><a name="l00079"></a><span class="lineno">   79</span>&#160;12.
