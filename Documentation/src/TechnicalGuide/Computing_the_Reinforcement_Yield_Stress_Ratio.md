Computing the Reinforcement Yield Stress Ratio {#computing_the_reinforcement_yield_stress_ratio}
==============================================

AASHTO MBE 6A.5.4.2.2b provides an optional evaluation to limit the stress in reinforcement during permit rating cases. When permit rating factors are computing using WSDOT BDM Equation 13.1.1A-2 the live load arrangement (arrangement of legal and permit vehicles) that produces the governing permit moment rating factor is used for the yield stress ratio computation.
