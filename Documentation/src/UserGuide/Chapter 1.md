Chapter 1 - Introduction {#chapter1}
==============================================

XBRate is a reinforced concrete cross beam load rating tool. Load ratings are performed in accordance with AASHTO Manual for Bridge Evaluation, Load and Resistance
Factor Ratings and the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) Bridge Design Manual.


Load rating calculations can be performed for:
* Inventory
* Operating
* Legal Loads with Routine Commercial Traffic
* Legal Loads with Specialized Hauling Vehicles
* Legal Loads with Emergency Vehicles
* Permit Loads for routine or annual permits
* Permit Loads for special or limited crossing permits

> NOTE: Legal Loads with Emergency Vehicles load rating is defined in FHWA Memorandum dated November 3, 2016 (https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/bridge/loadrating/161103.pdf). FHWA published the explainitory document [QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Load Rating for the FAST Act's Emergency Vehicles](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/bridge/loadrating/fast1410_qa.pdf), dated March 2017.


XBRate is part of the BridgeLink suite of applications published by WSDOT. XBRate functions as a general purpose, stand alone rating program. It also extends the PGSuper
and PGSplice applications to provide integrated cross beam load rating capabilities.

## Grids
Input grids are used throughout XBRate. While the contents of each grid is different, the basic commands for ending data into the grids is consistent throughout the program.


Two buttons, [+] and [-], are located to the right of each grid. The [+] button is used to add a row to the grid. The [-] button is used to delete the selected rows from the
grid.


Grid rows may be selected by clicking on the row header in the left-most column.
