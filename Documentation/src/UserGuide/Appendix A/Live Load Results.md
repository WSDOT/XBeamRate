Live Load Results {#appendix_a_live_load_results}
============
The Live Load Results view provides a graphical representation of the live load analysis performed by XBRate.

Item | Description
------|------------
Response Selector | Select desired structural response; Moment or Shear
Live Load Type | Use the drop down list to select the general live load type such as Design, Legal, or Permit
Vehicle Type | Use the drop down list to select a specific vehicle for the selected general live load type
Live Load Configuration | Select a live load configuration
[<] and [>] | Press these buttons to move the live load left and right
Permit vehicle in lane | Select the lane in which the permit vehicle is located

For Design and Legal live loads, as well as the Permit live load when the AASHTO MBE rating equation is used, three results graphs will be displayed:
1. Envelope for all of the vehicles associated with a Live Load Type
2. The response for a particular vehicle type
3. The response for a specific live load configuration

When the WSDOT BDM rating equation is used for Permit live loads, two results graphs will be displayed:
1. The response for the permit vehicle in a single lane
2. The response for the legal vehicle in all other lanes


The live load configuration is schematically shown on the graph including the wheel line reactions and positions.
