AASHTO {#appendix_a_concrete_aashto}
============
The parameters specific to the AASHTO LRFD concrete model are specified on this tab.

Item | Description
-----|------------
Averaging Factor, K1 | Enter the concrete averaging factor
Bounding Factor, K2 | Enter the concrete bounding factor
Agg. Splitting Strength, fct | Used for light weight concrete. When checked, enter the aggregate splitting strength.

Averaging and Bounding factors are defined in NCHRP Report 496. The modify the basic AASHTO equations for modulus of elasticity, creep, and shrinkage to account for locally sourced materials.
