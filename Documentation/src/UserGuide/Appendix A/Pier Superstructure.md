Superstructure {#appendix_a_pier_superstructure}
============
Geometric information about the superstructure is defined on this tab.

> NOTE: In XBRate, the superstructure is considered to be everything above the lower cross beam.

General
-----------

Item | Description
-----|------------
Pier Type | Select the pier type. Choices are Continous, Integral, and Expansion. 

Continous piers have a superstructure moment connection across the pier, but superstructure moments are not transmitted to the pier
Integral piers have a full moment connection between the superstructure and the pier.
Expansion piers do not transmit superstructure moments across or into the pier.

> NOTE: The schematic image updates to reflect the selected pier type

Roadway Layout
--------------
Items in this group define the roadway cross section geometry at the pier.

Skew | Enter the skew angle of the pier
Deck elevation at alignment | Enter the elevation of the roadway surface at the intersection of the centerline of the pier and the alignment
Left Crown Slope (SL) | Enter the slope on the left of the crown point
Right Crown Slope (SR) | Enter the slope on the right of the crown point
Crown Point Offset (CPO) | Enter the offset from the alignemnt to the crown point
Bridge Line Offset (BLO) | Enter the offset from the alignment to the bridge line
Curb Line Measured From | Enter the datum from which the curb lines are located
Left Curb Offset (LCO) | Enter the offset from the curb line datum to the left curb line
Right Curb Offset (RCO) | Enter the offset from the curb line datum to the right curb line
