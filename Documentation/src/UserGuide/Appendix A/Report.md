Report Options {#appendix_a_report}
============
This window lists the available chapters in a report. Check the box next to a chapter to include it in the report.

Multiple boxes can be check/unchecked at once by first selecting multiple chapters with the mouse pointer.

Results can be reported at even increments and controlling rating results, or at all locations that were analyzed. The former selection results in shorter output with less detail.
