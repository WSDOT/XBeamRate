Chapter 5 - Analysis Results {#chapter5}
==============================================
XBRate has tabular and graphical representations of analysis results. 

## Reports
XBRate has a single load rating report. This report contains the load rating analysis as well as all the supporting information including the detailed computation of rating factors and cross beam shear and moment capacity.

## Graphs
XBRate has two graphs; Analysis Results and Live Load Results. The Analysis Results graph displays shear and moment diagrams for the various loads and limit states as well as nominal capacities. The Live Load Results graph displays shear and moment diagrams for the controlling live load cases as well as diagrams for specific live load cases including a graphical representation of the live load arrangement.
