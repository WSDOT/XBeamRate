Review Analsyis Results {#pgs_analysis_results}
======================================
The Analysis Results and Live Load Results graphs are available in PGSuper/PGSplice. The names of these graphs are a little bit different then XBRate in stand alone mode so they can be easily distinguished from the other PGSuper/PGSplice graphs.


To create the XBRate analysis results graphs:
1. Select *View > Graphs > Cross Beam Analysis Results*
2. Select *View > Graphs > Cross Beam Live Load Results*
